# Overview
Demonstrates OOP design in MATLAB including:
- App design
- Input validation with arguments blocks
- Properties and attributes
- Inheritance
- Packages
- Static methods
- Unit tests and test suites

Provide an app for rolling dice for D&D...

# TODO
- Implement PercentileDice?
- Implement AppDesigner GUI.

# Ideas
- ContinuousDie: a die with an infinite number of sides which have values within a certain range. Nonphysical but might be interesting...Could also consider allowing multiple ranges, e.g. a die which can roll 1 to 5 or 10 to 15. Useful or not, weighting would be very interesting.
- SymbolicDie: for images instead of text. Uses could include a mood die for emojis or a weather die with various weather icons. It seems a categoric die accomplishs all the same things, though, and is much easier to use for any form of data analysis.
- D&D dice: d2, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, cardinal directions
- 3D die simulator using Simulink...compare random and chaotic...single die builder.
