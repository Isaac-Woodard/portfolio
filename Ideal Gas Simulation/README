### Overview
The program is a GUI application which simulates the collisions of idealized spherical particles in a three dimensional container. The program was written for use in a student lab in PHYS 309 at Boise State University. 

Features of the program include:
- Modifying the number of particles from 1-500
- Adjusting the temperature of the system by selecting a target temperature
- Changing the simulation speed
- Counting the number of particles within a certain range of speeds
- Displaying an ideal Maxwell-Boltzmann probability distribution for the current temperature
