### Overview
I wrote several plugins for ImageJ, an open source program written in Java, as part of a self-guided image processing research course. The plugins are exercises from Principles of Digital Image Processing Vol I - Fundamental Techniques by Wilhelm Burger and Mark J. Burge. Topics covered include histograms, point operations, filters, greyscale images, and RGB images.

### Usage
Install ImageJ from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/. Run ImageJ and select either "Install..." or "Compile and Run..." from the Plugins menu. Installing the plugin to the plugins folder will make it accessible from the Plugin menu.
