### Overview
I wrote several plugins for ImageJ as part of a self-guided image processing research course. ImageJ is an open source program written in Java for image processing and analysis. The plugins are exercises from Principles of Digital Image Processing Vol I - Fundamental Techniques by Wilhelm Burger and Mark J. Burge. There is a companion website for the text at https://imagingbook.com/. 

### Usage
Install ImageJ from https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/. Run ImageJ and select either "Install..." or "Compile and Run..." from the Plugins menu. Installing the plugin to the plugins folder will make it accessible from the Plugin menu.
